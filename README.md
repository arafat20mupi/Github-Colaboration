Creating a Pull Request on GitHub involves the following steps:

   - Click "Compare & pull request."
   - Add a title and description to your pull request, explaining the changes you've made.
   - Select the base branch of the original repository (usually `development` or `Your_branch`) and your branch from the dropdown.
   - Click "Create pull request."
